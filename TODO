TODO:
✓✓✓ Rework the spots in c_backend that use AST_FLAG_CALL_IS_*,
    get those flag bits back
✓✓✓ Perform CFA to determine if a procedure will always return a value
    (see bJou code on 42 for some inspiration)
✓✓✓ Add an ast_expanded_macro_t node that will have padding.
    We need to do something about this huge ident/bin expr situation.
    Perhaps also try to remove the macro_decl field in ast_t (would love to get back to 64b)
✓✓✓ u64 -> s64?
✓✓✓ Polymorphic expressions solving with slices.
✓✓✓ sizeof, typeof
-   Block macros?
-   Macro export
-   Sum types
-   match statement
-   "did you mean...?"
-   Specialization return type?
-   Macro varargs
-   madvise MADV_SEQUENTIAL and MADV_WILLNEED may be good to add to parser file mappings
