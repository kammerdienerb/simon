# Got a basic form of macro expansion working. Need to extend it for the other
# built in macros (require, static_if), and then start working on user-defined
# macros.
#
# UPDATE:
# This still has some problems...
# The way we've designed the user-defined macros is that they can get replaced with
# whatever kind of node the macro expands to. But how are we going to validate code
# after that? For example:
#
#        make_a_decl :: macro() {
#            FOO :: 123;
#        }
#
#        bar := make_a_decl!();
#
# How are we going to avoid an impossible number of scenarios where a node expects its
# child to be something specific? In this case, the variable expects its initialization
# to be an expression, but it will end up being a declaration. Maybe we should have some
# way to bubble down the expected node type to the point where we create the macro call
# node. Then when we expand it, we make sure that the resulting node is of that type.
# So here, by the time we get to parse_macro_call(), we would have informed it that the
# macro is a MACRO_EXPR, or something. Then when it gets expanded, we throw an error
# because it results in a declaration node instead. That might work, but we'll need to
# work through some of the more complicated cased (like block macros) to be sure.
#
# Further update (june):
# Concerning declarations within a macro:
# What if private declarations have their name mangled every time the macro is expanded
# in expand_macro() or somewhere in copy_tree()? This could be an easy way to get this
# working such that C code generation is easy (might "Just work" TM). It will, however,
# place more restrictions on valid identifiers (i.e. whatever we use for the mangling
# will be disallowed).


### Interesting ideas:
# CPU :: struct {
#     [[ bitfield_struct(u16) ]]
#     Register_16 :: struct {
#         [[ bitfield(0, 15) ]]  _16: u16;
#         [[ bitfield(0, 7)  ]]  lo:  u16;
#         [[ bitfield(8, 15) ]]  hi:  u16;
#         [[ bitfield(3, 9)  ]]  flags: u8;
#     }

#     AR: Register_16;
#         [[ field_alias(AR.lo) ]] A: u16;
#         [[ field_alias(AR.hi) ]] R: u16;
# }

# Vec3 :: struct(%T: type) {
#     array: [3]T;

#     [[ field_alias(array[0]) ]] x: T;
#     [[ field_alias(array[1]) ]] y: T;
#     [[ field_alias(array[2]) ]] z: T;
# }
